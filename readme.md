Based on the Alien Invasion [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) project in [Python Crash Course, 2nd edition](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e) by Eric Matthes.

I added the following:
- Enemies shoot bullets.
- Difficulty levels with scaled scoring.
- Buttons for selecting difficulty at the beginning.
- Sounds, created with [Helm](https://tytel.org/helm/).
